# Northgrove Timelapse Frontend
A simple frontend for viewing timelapses of the Northgrove house building project.

This frontend downloads a metadata.json file from Cloudflare R2 storage, which details what timelapse segments are available.

It displays these as the current day, current week, full timelapse, or allows the user to select which week they want to view.
